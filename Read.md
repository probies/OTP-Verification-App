### Create an API key

To create an API key in a project, the user must be granted the Editor basic role (roles/editor) on the project. See basic roles for more information.

    To create an API key:

    1. Navigate to the APIs & Servicesâ†’Credentials panel in Cloud Console.

    2. Select Create credentials, then select API key from the dropdown menu.

    3. The API key created dialog box displays your newly created key. An API key is a long string containing upper and lower case letters, numbers, and dashes. For example, a4db08b7-5729-4ba9-8c08-f2df493465a1.

You might want to copy your key and keep it secure. Unless you are using a testing key that you intend to delete later, add application and API key restrictions.
